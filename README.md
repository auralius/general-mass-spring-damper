# general-mass-spring-damper
Derive the symbolic equations of motion of a mass-spring-damper system (in one dimension only)

Please read the [how-to-use.pdf](./how-to-use.pdf) to learn how to generate the two connection matrices: for springs and for dampers. A connection matrix is a visual representation of how the masses are connected one to another. It has no mathematical meaning and is diffrent as in state space represtation of a mass-spring-damper system.
