# general-mass-spring-damper
Derive the symbolic equations of motion of a mass-spring-damper system (in one dimension only)

Please read the how-to-use.pdf to learn how to generate connectoin matrices. A connection matrix is the visual representation of how the masses are connected one to another. It has no mathematical meaning and is diffrent as in state space represtation of a mass-spring-damper system.
